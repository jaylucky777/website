##ORDER BY
With SQL, you can also order the rows of your output.  Suppose we would like to see all instances of a playe hitting more than 50 home runs.  But we would like the players with the most homeruns to be at the top.  We could do the following:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting 
WHERE HR>50 
ORDER BY HR DESC"
sqldf(query)
```
